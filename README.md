# imessage-assistant
iMessage assistant outputs the people you may have forgotten to respond to (Mac only).

The program asks for full disk access, which means that it can read the contents of your machine. Don't worry! The program makes **no** network requests. All data is stored locally to maintain privacy.

The python code is out of date. Load the mac app via Xcode (good luck) or message Shekar to get the packaged mac app. Thanks!
