# MessageMate

MessageMate reminds you if you&apos;ve forgotten to respond to an iMessage. Your data never leaves your Mac.

## Details

MessageMate asks for full disk access, which means that it can read the contents of your machine. Don't worry! MessageMate only makes network requests to handle payments, which means your data **never** leaves your laptop. **It's completely private.**

You can find the only network requests made in `Payment.swift`.

You can run MessageMate yourself or purchase it for $7 here: [messagemate.io](https://www.messagemate.io). There is a 7 day free trial with no credit card required.
