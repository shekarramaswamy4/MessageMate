# imessage-assistant
iMessage assistant outputs the people you may have forgotten to respond to (Mac only).

The program asks for full disk access, which means that it can read the contents of your machine. Don't worry! The program makes **no** network requests. All data is stored locally to maintain privacy.

# Usage
python3 explore.py 

# Roadmap
- improve suggestions suggestion algorithm
- make suggestions interactive, aka deeplink from terminal directly into messages app
- make this a mac app???
- better onboarding (make using the program a one command process)
